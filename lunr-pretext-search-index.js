You may be looking at the last two rows of the truth table and wondering what's going on. For lay people, the statement is meaningless when is false. But then wouldn't be a statement. Statements must have a truth value!   Consider the statement, \"If two is odd, then one is even.\" The constituent statements \"two is odd\" and \"one is even\" are both false, and the compound statement is defined to true. Any implication with the premise \"two is odd\" is vacuously true.   In formal mathematical logic, no causation in implied by an if-then statement. That is, the statement, \"If it's raining, then it's wet outside\" doesn't the same thing as, \"It's wet outside because it is raining.\" For all we know, it could be wet outside because someone sprayed everything down with a fire hose. And so, even though the statement, \"If , then Mars is a planet,\" is a true statement, we don't infer that the truth of the conclusion is dependent on its causal relationship to the premise (\"Mars is a planet\" is true regardless of arithmetic!).

In math, we understand propositions (and theorems, lemmas, corollaries, etc.) to be statements that are true (and proved\/provable) so that we can cite them when we need to use them. You can see the confusion that would ensue if a paper contained \"Proposition 1: All even integers are prime\" under that assumption, even if followed immediately by a counterexample! So, if you are showing that a statement is not true as part of a writing assignment, here's what that might look like:   Example  It is not the case that every even integer is prime. Notice that the integer is even. Although divides , it divides neither nor . Therefore, by (definition of prime\/proposition about prime numbers\/whatever it is), is not prime.
