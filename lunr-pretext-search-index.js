  "body": " Introduction  In many mathematics courses, students learn how to apply known, established mathematical facts to problems that need solutions: \"Farmer Bill wants to build a rectangular pen for his sheep with 25 yards of fence material, and he would like to maximize their grazing potential. Find the dimensions of the pen he should build.\" This type of education is important, but it is also incomplete. It does not help a student learn to create mathematics.  In contrast, mathematical reasoning, built upon the foundation of formal logic, is the art of deducing consequences from basic assumptions. Over time, these consequences (called theorems among other names) invoke fewer of the basic assumptions (called axioms ) and instead rely on secondary axioms, defintions, and other theorems. As a body, mathematicians have agreed upon a specialized dialect designed to clearly and precisely describe mathematical ideas to one another. In a very small nutshell, this is why mathematicians write proofs.  This short primer is designed to introduce this dialect, built upon formal logic, so that fledgling mathematicians may begin to discover, prove, and communicate new mathematics. Moreover, it is a work in progress by Professor Gibbons; if you have comments, criticisms, or suggestions for improvement, don't hesitate to let her know.  "

Logical implication    The compound statement \"if , then \" or \" implies \" is called an implication or a conditional statement , denoted , where is referred to as the hypothesis or premise and is referred to as the conclusion . The implication is defined by the truth table below.   Truth Table for Implication         T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T     An implication in which the premise is false is called vacuously true .    You may be looking at the last two rows of the truth table and wondering what's going on. For lay people, the statement is meaningless when is false. But then wouldn't be a statement. Statements must have a truth value!   Consider the statement, \"If two is odd, then one is even.\" The constituent statements \"two is odd\" and \"one is even\" are both false, and the compound statement is defined to true. Any implication with the premise \"two is odd\" is vacuously true.   In formal mathematical logic, no causation in implied by an if-then statement. That is, the statement, \"If it's raining, then it's wet outside\" doesn't the same thing as, \"It's wet outside because it is raining.\" For all we know, it could be wet outside because someone sprayed everything down with a fire hose. And so, even though the statement, \"If , then Mars is a planet,\" is a true statement, we don't infer that the truth of the conclusion is dependent on its causal relationship to the premise (\"Mars is a planet\" is true regardless of arithmetic!).   Negating Implications   For any statements and ,    , and     .        We see from the truth tables for and that these statements are logically equivalent.

For the remaining equivalence, we have    There are three implications that are related to the statement , and they are defined as follows.    Let and be statements and consider the implication . The converse of is the statement . The inverse of is the statement . The contrapositive of is the statement .    Observe that the implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive . The converse is logically equivalent to the inverse .

Converse of  If it's wet ouside, then it's raining.    Inverse of  If it's not raining, then it's not wet outside.    Contrapositive of  If it's not wet outside, then it's not raining.

Thus there exists an integer for which . It follows that . Since , we see that is odd and therefore not even.      Proof by Contradiction  In a proof by contradiction, we show the statement is true by showing it cannot possibly be false (we're really invoking the Law of the Excluded Middle here). In other words, we assume that the entire implication is false, and then we show that this contradicts some other known result.  Remember that an implication is false exactly when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. That is, by the Law of Implication (b), .   Claim.

Other Logical Equivalences  As our implications become more complicated, like , we will develop logical equivalences to make these statements easier to prove. Often this means moving the implication symbol as far to the right as possible so that we can assume as much as possible. Then, prove the new implication directly.  Having established in a previous exercise that , we can use this equivalence to prove the following statement.   Claim. For all integers and , if is even, then or is even.   Let and be integers.

In math, we understand propositions (and theorems, lemmas, corollaries, etc.) to be statements that are true (and proved\/provable) so that we can cite them when we need to use them. You can see the confusion that would ensue if a paper contained Proposition 1: All even integers are prime under that assumption, even if followed immediately by a counterexample! So, if you are showing that a statement is not true as part of a writing assignment, here's what that might look like:   Example  It is not the case that every even integer is prime. Notice that the integer is even. Although divides , it divides neither nor . Therefore, by (definition of prime\/proposition about prime numbers\/whatever it is), is not prime.   To break that down into more of a template:   Example   [Topic sentence: what's the point of this example?]  [Supporting mathematical evidence, less formal than a proof, but still following the stylistic conventions of good mathematical writing!]  [Concluding sentence.]    "
