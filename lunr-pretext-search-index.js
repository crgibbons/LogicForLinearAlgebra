  "body": " Introduction  In many mathematics courses, students learn how to apply known, established mathematical facts to problems that need solutions: \"Farmer Bill wants to build a rectangular pen for his sheep with 25 yards of fence material, and he would like to maximize their grazing potential. Find the dimensions of the pen he should build.\" This type of education is important, but it is also incomplete. It does not help a student learn to create mathematics.  In contrast, mathematical reasoning, built upon the foundation of formal logic, is the art of deducing consequences from basic assumptions. Over time, these consequences (called theorems among other names) invoke fewer of the basic assumptions (called axioms ) and instead rely on secondary axioms, defintions, and other theorems. As a body, mathematicians have agreed upon a specialized dialect designed to clearly and precisely describe mathematical ideas to one another. In a very small nutshell, this is why mathematicians write proofs.  This short primer is designed to introduce this dialect, built upon formal logic, so that fledgling mathematicians may begin to discover, prove, and communicate new mathematics. Moreover, it is a work in progress by Professor Gibbons; if you have comments, criticisms, or suggestions for improvement, don't hesitate to let her know.  "

In math, we understand propositions (and theorems, lemmas, corollaries, etc.) to be statements that are true (and proved\/provable) so that we can cite them when we need to use them. You can see the confusion that would ensue if a paper contained \"Proposition 1: All even integers are prime\" under that assumption, even if followed immediately by a counterexample! So, if you are showing that a statement is not true as part of a writing assignment, here's what that might look like:   Example  It is not the case that every even integer is prime. Notice that the integer is even. Although divides , it divides neither nor . Therefore, by (definition of prime\/proposition about prime numbers\/whatever it is), is not prime.   To break that down into more of a template:   Example   [Topic sentence: what's the point of this example?]  [Supporting mathematical evidence, less formal than a proof, but still following the stylistic conventions of good mathematical writing!]  [Concluding sentence.]    "
