# Logic for Proof-Writing

This short booklet is designed for roughly 3 hours of class covering enough logic to get started writing proofs in a linear algebra course.

It includes an introduction, followed by
1. Connectives (not, or, and, if); with exercises!
2. Quantifiers (existential and universal); with exercises!
3. Proof Techniques (direct, contrapositive, contradiction, and other logical equivalences); with exercises!
4. More Exercises!

Plus an appendix on the conventions of good mathematical writing (as told by me, Courtney Gibbons) and an appendix on set theory basics.

It is written in [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org), entirely in the cloud, using GitHub Codespaces.
