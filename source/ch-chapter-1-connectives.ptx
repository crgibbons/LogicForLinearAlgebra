  <title>Connectives</title>
  <introduction> 
    <p> Just as numbers are the building blocks of arithmetic, statements are the building blocks of formal proofs.  However, the value of a statement is is not numerical; the value of statement is called its <term>truth value</term>, which comes in two flavors: True and False.  And, just as we can define operations like addition or division on numbers, we can define operations on statements, called <term>logical connectives</term>.</p>
      
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>A <term>statement</term> is a sentence that is unambiguously true or false.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <title>Statements and non-statements</title>
      	<p>
			<q>Hamilton College is located in Clinton, NY</q> is a statement; its truth value is <q>true.</q>
			Furthermore, <q>Our class meets sixteen days a week</q> is a statement; its truth value is <q>false.</q>
		</p>
      	<p>
			On the other hand, <q>Green is the best color</q> is not a statement, 
			because its truth value isn't well-defined; that is, the truth of the statement is ambiguous.
		</p>
    </example>

    <p>
		Regarding notation: we will typically reserve the variables <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>, <m>r</m> (and so on) as 
		<term>propositional variables</term> (meaning that they are statements).
