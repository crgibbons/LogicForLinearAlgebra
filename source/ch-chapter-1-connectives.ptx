  <title>Connectives</title>
  <introduction> 
    <p> Just as numbers are the building blocks of arithmetic, statements are the building blocks of formal proofs.  However, the value of a statement is is not numerical; the value of statement is called its <term>truth value</term>, which comes in two flavors: True and False.  And, just as we can define operations like addition or division on numbers, we can define operations on statements, called <term>logical connectives</term>.</p>
      
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>A <term>statement</term> is a sentence that is unambiguously true or false.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <title>Statements and non-statements</title>
      	<p>
			<q>Hamilton College is located in Clinton, NY</q> is a statement; its truth value is <q>true.</q>
			Furthermore, <q>Our class meets sixteen days a week</q> is a statement; its truth value is <q>false.</q>
		</p>
      	<p>
			On the other hand, <q>Green is the best color</q> is not a statement, 
			because its truth value isn't well-defined; that is, the truth of the statement is ambiguous.
		</p>
    </example>

    <p>
		Regarding notation: we will typically reserve the variables <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>, <m>r</m> (and so on) as 
		<term>propositional variables</term> (meaning that they are statements).

<!-- section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}[series=exercises]
		\item Given the statements below, write (in sentences!) the compound statements.
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item $p \land q$;
			\item $q \lor (\lnot r)$; 
			\item $p \land (\lnot q)$;  
			\item $p \land q \land r$.
		\end{enumerate}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[$p$:] The car will not start.
			\item[$q$:] It is freezing outside.
			\item[$r$:] The food is ready.
		\end{itemize} 
		\item Given the statements above, write the following sentences in logical notation:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The car will start and it is freezing outside.
			\item Either the food is ready or it is freezing outside.
			\item The food isn't ready and the car won't start.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Construct a truth table for each of the following statements:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item $p \land (\lnot q)$;
			\item $p \lor (q \land (\lnot p))$;
			\item $p \land (q \lor (\lnot p))$;
			\item $p \land (\lnot q)$.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Identify the hypothesis $p$ and the conclusion $q$ in each of the following conditional statements:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item I will go to the movies if it rains.
			\item If the diagonals of a rectangle are not perpendicular, it is not a square.
			\item If $x > 0$ and $y > 0$, then $x+y > 0$.
			\item $f(x)$ is a function on $[a,b]$ implies that $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
			\item I will pay \$5 for a cup of coffee only if elephants fly.
			\item All sides are equal provided that $T$ is an equilateral triangle.
			\item Parellel opposite sides is sufficient for a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item {\it Use truth tables} to prove that disjunction and conjunction are associative and that each one distributes over the other.  That is, for all statements  $p$, $q$  and  $r$, prove that:
			\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
				\item $(p \land q) \land r \equiv p \land (q \land r)$
				\item $(p \lor q) \lor r \equiv p \lor (q \lor r)$
				\item $p \land( q \lor r) \equiv (p \land q)  \lor ( p \land r)$ 
				\item $p \lor( q \land r) \equiv (p \lor q)  \land ( p \lor r)$
			\end{enumerate}

		\item Is implication associative?  That is, is it true that 
		\[
		\left [(p \implies q) \implies r \right ]  \equiv \left [ p \implies(q \implies r)\right ]?
		\]
		Justify your answer!\\
		\item For the contrapositive, converse, and inverse of each of the following statements in the form of an English sentence (no symbolic logic notation):
			\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
				\item If two lines are perpendicular, then they intersect at a right angle.
				\item Function $f(x)$ is differentiable provided that $f(x)$ is a polynomial.
				\item \underline{Divergence Test:} If $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges, then $\lim_{n\to \infty} a_n = 0$.
				\item \underline{Theorem 1.6} (abbreviated version) For all $A, B \in M_{m,n}$, if $A$ and $B$ are both nonsingular, then $AB$ is nonsingular.
