<title> Set Theory Basics</title>

<p>
	Every set <m>A</m> is made up of its members.  
  If <m>a</m> is a member of <m>A</m>, we write <m>a \in A</m>, 
  and we use the symbol <q><m>\in</m></q> as the mathematical equivalent of the phrase <q>is a member of</q>.
</p>
<p>
	We think of sets as their own objects.  
  If <m>B</m> is another set, and if for every <m>a \in A</m> it follows that <m>a \in B</m>, 
  then we say that <m>A</m> is a <term><em>subset</em></term> of <m>B</m>, and we write <m>A \subseteq B</m>.
</p>
<p>
	For example, <m>\{1,2\}</m> is a subset of <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> 
  (i.e., <m>\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}</m>), but <m>\{1,4\}</m> is not 
  (i.e., <m>\{1,4\} \not \subseteq \{1,2,3\}</m>). 
  From this definition, it is clear that a set is a subset of itself. 
   We say that the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equal (and we write <m>A = B</m>) if and only if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq A</m>.
</p>
<p>
	Just as arithmetic features operations on numbers, set theory features operations on sets:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		 The <term><em>union</em></term> of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A \cup B</m>, is the set of all objects that are a member of <m>A</m>, or <m>B</m>, or both. Example: <me>\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{2, 3, 4\}=\{1, 2, 3, 4\}</me>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <term><em>intersection</em></term> of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A \cap B</m>, 
      is the set of all objects that are members of both
      <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Example: <me>\{1, 2, 3\}\cap \{2, 3, 4\}= \{2, 3\}. </me>
  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	There are lots of other operations on sets 
  (<em>set difference</em>, <em>symmetric difference</em>, <em>Cartesian product</em>, <em>power set</em>, 
  <em>disjoint union</em>, <em>complement</em>, and more!), 
  but to start, we only need to worry about unions and intersections.
</p>
<p>
	Some basic sets of central importance to us in linear algebra are:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>
      the empty set (the unique set containing no elements), which we denote by <m>\{ \, \}</m> or <m>\varnothing</m>;
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      the set of natural numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{N}</m>;
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      the set of integers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>;
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      the set of rational numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>;
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      the set of real numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{R}</m>; and
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      the set of complex numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
