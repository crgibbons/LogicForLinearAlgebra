  <title> Set Theory Basics</title>

  <p>
    Every set <m>A</m> is made up of its members.
    If <m>a</m> is a member of <m>A</m>, we write <m>a \in A</m>, and we use the symbol <q><m>\in</m></q> as the mathematical equivalent of the phrase <q>is a member of</q>.
    A set with no elements is called <term>empty</term>, and we denote the empty set by <m>\{ \, \}</m> or <m>\varnothing</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If membership in a set is governed by a rule, we can use <term>set-builder notation</term> to describe the set. Set-builder notation is formatted
    <me>
      \{ \text{ elements of } U \, | \, \text{ subject to this rule }\}.
    </me>
    For example, the set of even integers can be described by 
    <me>
      \{ n \text{ in the integers} \, | \, n = 2k \text{ for some integer } k \}.
    </me>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    We think of sets as their own abstract objects, and typically we situate them within a larger universal set <m>U</m> in order to perform operations on sets.
    If <m>B</m> is another set, and if for every <m>a \in A</m> it follows that <m>a \in B</m>, then we say that <m>A</m> is a <term><em>subset</em></term> of <m>B</m>, and we write <m>A \subseteq B</m>.
    We also say <m>A</m> is a <term>superset</term> <m>B</m> in this scenario, and we can write <m>A \supseteq B</m>.

  <p>
    For example, <m>\{1,2\}</m> is a subset of <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> (i.e., <m>\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}</m>), but <m>\{1,4\}</m> is not (i.e., <m>\{1,4\} \not \subseteq \{1,2,3\}</m>).
    From this definition, it is clear that a set is a subset of itself.
    We say that the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equal (and we write <m>A = B</m>) if and only if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq A</m>.

  <p>
    Just as arithmetic features operations on numbers, set theory features operations on sets:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <term>complement</term> of a set <m>A</m> is formed by the elements <m>u \in U</m> that are not members of <m>A</m>.
        For example, in the set of natural numbers,
        <me>
          \{1, 2, 3 \}^c = \{4, 5, 6, \dots\}.
        </me>
      </p>

        The <term>union</term> of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A \cup B</m>, is the set of all elements in <m>U</m> that are a member of <m>A</m>, or <m>B</m>, or both.
        For example, in the set of natural numbers,
        <me>

        The <term><em>intersection</em></term> of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A \cap B</m>, is the set of all elements that are members of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

        <me>
          \{1, 2, 3\}\cap \{2, 3, 4\}= \{2, 3\}.

    There are lots of other operations on sets (<em>set difference</em>, <em>symmetric difference</em>, <em>Cartesian product</em>, <em>power set</em>, <em>disjoint union</em>, <em>complement</em>, and more!), but to start, we only need to worry about complements, unions, and intersections.

        The laws for negations of conjunctions and disjunctions have natural counterparts for sets. Indeed, 
      <me>
        (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c

    Some basic sets of central importance to us in linear algebra are:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of natural numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{N}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of integers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of rational numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of real numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{R}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of complex numbers, which we denote by <m>\mathbb{C}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of column vectors with <m>d</m> entries, which we denote <m>\mathbb{R}^d</m>; and
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the set of <m>m \times n </m> matrices with real entries, which we denote by <m>M_{m\times n}</m>.
        When <m>m = n</m>, we write <m>M_n</m>.
