  <title>Quantifiers</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> If we read the sentences, "He is taller than that," or "She is from Darien, CT," or even "<m>x^2 \geq y + 4</m>," 
      we note that they are not statements because their truth values are ambiguous. After all, who is he? What is that? Who is she?
      Which values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are we considering? If we knew the answers to these questions, these sentences would be statements; 
      such sentences are called <term>propositional functions</term>, and we make statements out of them using quantifiers.

        A <term>propositional function</term> is a sentence that becomes a statement when ambiguity is removed.
        We denote a propositional function as <m>p(x)</m> if it results in a simple statement or <m>P(x,y)</m> if it results in a compound statement.

        The statement, "For all real numbers <m>x</m>, <m>x^2 \geq 0</m>" is a universally quantified statement with a truth value of true.

<!-- The set $D$, for which $\forall x \in D$ or $\exists x \in D$, is called the \textit{\textbf{domain of discourse}}.  This almost literally translates to ``the set we're talking about'' (as in, ``there exists $x$ that is an element of the set we're talking about'').

\begin{example} Recall Theorem 1.1d from our course textbook:
\[\forall A \in M_{m,n}, \exists D \in M_{m,n} \suchthat A + D = D + A = 0.\]

The domain of discourse in this example is the set of $m \times n$ matrices.

What if we reverse the quantifiers?
\[\exists A \in M_{m,n} \forall D \in M_{m,n} \suchthat A + D = D + A = 0.\]
Parsing this sentence in English, we have, ``There exists an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ for all $m \times n$ matrices $D$ such that $A + D = D + A = 0$.''  This really says that there's some matrix $A$ that's the additive inverse for \textit{every} matrix $D$.  This statement is false!
\end{example}

\begin{defn} The negations of the logical quantifiers are defined to be 
\begin{align*}
\lnot[\forall x, p(x)] &\equiv \exists x \suchthat \lnot p(x) \\
\lnot[\exists x \suchthat q(x)] &\equiv \forall x [\lnot q(x)].
\end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{example} Let's negate the following statements: ``For all $\female$ in the set of women in our class, $\female$ is from Darien, CT'' and ``There exists a $\male$ in the set of men in our class such that $\male$ is taller than the Eiffel Tower.''

The first statement, negated, is equivalent to ``There is a $\female$ in  the set of women in our class such that $\female$ is not from Darien, CT'' (or: ``There's a woman in our class who's not from Darien, CT'').

The second statement, negated, is equivalent to ``For all $\male$ in the set of men in our class, $\male$ is not taller than the Eiffel Tower'' (or: ``All of the men in our class are shorter than the Eiffel Tower'').
\end{example}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}[resume=exercises]
	\item Let $P(x,y)$ denote $x \geq y$.  Determine whether the following statement are true or false; justify your answer.
			\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
				\item $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{N}, P(x,y)$
				\item $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, \exists y \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(x,y)$
				\item $\exists x \in  \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall y \in \mathbb{N}$,  $P(x,y)$
				\item $\exists x,y \in  \mathbb{N}$ such that $P(x,y)$
			\end{enumerate}
	\item Write down the negation of the following statements, moving the negation symbol $\lnot$ as far to the right as possible. Use  symbolic logic notation.
			\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
				\item $\forall x \in A \left [ p(x) \implies q(x) \right ]$ 
				\item $\exists x \in A $ such that $ \left [ \left ( \lnot p(x)\right ) \land q(x) \right ]$ 
				\item $\forall x \in A \left [ p(x) \implies \left ( \exists y \in B \text{ such that } \left [ q(x,y) \land r(x,y) \right] \right ) \right ]$
			\end{enumerate}
	\item Rewrite the following sentence using symbolic logic notation for the logical connectives and quantifiers ($\mathcal{F}$ denotes the set of all functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$).\\
		``For any function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ that is continuous on $[a, b]$, there is some $c \in [a,b]$  such that for all $x\in [a,b]$, $f(c) \leq f(x)$.''
	
	\end{enumerate}
