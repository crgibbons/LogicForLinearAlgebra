        <statement>
            <p>
                The compound statement "if <m>p</m>, then <m>q</m>" or "<m>p</m> implies <m>q</m>"
                 is called an <term>implication</term> or a <term>conditional statement</term>, denoted <m>p \implies q</m>,
                 where <m>p</m> is referred to as the <term>hypothesis</term> or <term>premise</term> and <m>q</m> is referred to
                 as the <term>conclusion</term>. The implication is defined by the truth table below.

                 <table>
                    <title>Truth Table for Implication</title>
                    <tabular halign="center">
                    <row header = "yes" bottom = "minor"><cell><m>p</m></cell><cell><m>q</m></cell><cell><m>p\lor q</m></cell></row>

                </table>

                An implication in which the premise is false is called <term>vacuously true</term>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    
    <p>You may be looking at the last two rows of the truth table and wondering what's going on. For lay people, the statement <m>p \implies q</m>
        is meaningless when <m>p</m> is false. But then <m>p \implies q</m> wouldn't be a statement. Statements must have a truth value!</p>

    <example>
        <p> 
            Consider the statement, "If two is odd, then one is even." The constituent statements "two is odd" and "one is even" are both false,
            and the compound statement is defined to true. Any implication with the premise "two is odd" is vacuously true.
        </p>
    </example>

    <p>In formal mathematical logic, no causation in implied by an if-then statement. That is, the statement, "If it's raining, then it's wet outside"
    doesn't the same thing as, "It's wet outside <em>because</em> it is raining." For all we know, it could be wet outside because someone sprayed
    everything down with a fire hose. And so, even though the statement, "If <m>2+2=5</m>, then Mars is a planet," is a true statement, we don't infer
    that the truth of the conclusion is dependent on its causal relationship to the premise ("Mars is a planet" is true regardless of arithmetic!).</p>

        <title>Negating Implications</title>

    <p>There are three implications that are related to the statement <m>p \implies q</m>, and they are defined as follows.</p>

In addition to the conditional, there's a compound statement that we know well from our mathematical upbringing. 

\begin{defn} The \defi{biconditional} of statements $p$ and $q$ is the compound statement ``$p$ if and only if $q$,'' denoted $p \iff q$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c | c }
$p$ & $q$ & $p \iff q$ \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & F \\
F & F & T 
\end{tabular}
\caption{The truth table for the biconditional statement $p \iff q$.}
\end{figure}
Some verbiage we use to describe the biconditional is, ``$p$ is necessary and sufficient for $q$.'' In particular, ``$p$ is necessary for $q$'' describes the implication $q \implies p$, and ``$p$ is sufficient for $q$'' describes the implication $p \implies q$.
\end{defn}

\begin{example}\label{biconditionalequiv}It's no surprise that \[[p \iff q] \equiv [(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)].\] Indeed, we can see this from the truth tables:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c | c || c | c | c }
$p$ & $q$ & $p \iff q$ & $p \implies q$ & $q \implies p$ & $(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$\\
\hline
T & T & T & T & T & T\\
T & F & F & F & T & F \\
F & T & F & T & F & F\\
F & F & T & T & T & T
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[All mathematical definitions are biconditional statements] A matrix is symmetric \textit{if and only if} it equals its own transpose.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[The contrapositve of the biconditional] From the equivalences we've established, we see
\begin{align*}(\lnot p) \iff (\lnot q) 
&\equiv [(\lnot p) \implies (\lnot q)] \land [(\lnot q) \implies (\lnot p)]&\text{ Example~\ref{biconditionalequiv}}\\
&\equiv
(q \implies p) \land (p \implies q)& \text{Contrapositve of ``$\implies$''}\\
&\equiv p \iff q &\text{Example~\ref{biconditionalequiv}}.
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{defn} A \defi{tautology} is a compound statement that is true for all truth values of its constituent statements.  A \defi{contradiction} is a compound statement that is fall for all truth values of its constituent statements.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c || c || c  }
$p$ & $\lnot p$ & $p \lor (\lnot p)$ & $p \land (\lnot p)$ \\
\hline
T & F & T & F \\
F & T & T & F 
\end{tabular}
\caption{The compound statement $p \lor (\lnot p)$ is a tautology, and the compound statement $p \land (\lnot p)$ is a contradiction.}
\end{figure}

We refer to the tautology $p \lor (\lnot p)$ as the Law of the Excluded Middle.
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}[The Logical Rule of Inference] More generally, we say that a compound implication $P \implies Q$ is a tautology whenever the truth values of the constituent propositions make $P$ true (because, in this case, $Q$ is also true).
\end{remark}
