    <title>Style Conventions for Formal Mathematical Writing</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>If you've taken proofs classes from different professors, you know that we share some basic beliefs about writing, but we also have our own quirks and preferences. (If you haven't yet taken proofs classes from different professors... get ready! We share some basic beliefs, but we also have our own quirks and preferences). What you'll see below are the guidelines that I consider the standards for submitting to the Gibbons Journal of Mathematics (by which I mean, sending in a writing assignment to be assessed in a proofs class that you're taking with me).</p>

      <p>Mathematical writing breaks into three (entangled) pieces: Logic, Mathematics, and Style.</p>

      <section xml:id="logic">
        <title>Logic</title>
        <p> Authors should adhere to the rules of logic in such a way that their readers understand what logical techniques they are employing.</p>
        
        <p>In other words, the authors...</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>state claims (propositions, theorems, lemmas, etc.) as logical statements;</p></li>
            <li><p>state claims appropriate to the assigned problem;</p></li>
            <li><p>write proofs with first and last sentences that indicate the proof technique they are using;*</p></li>
            <li><p>define notation and symbols before using them;</p></li>
            <li><p>employ a valid proof technique for the statement as written;</p></li>
            <li><p>employ a valid proof technique for the statement appropriate to the problem;</p></li>
            <li><p>include all necessary cases in the proof;</p></li>
            <li><p>write examples with a clear topic sentence;</p></li>
            <li><p>write prose using evidence to support claims;</p></li>
            <li><p>employ sound logic even in mathematical prose.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>*this criterion relaxes a bit after the first proofs course; if you're proving a theorem directly, you can just get to the proof without repeating the hypotheses at the beginning of the proof. But if you're in your first proofs course, please include the first and last sentences that lay out your hypotheses and conclusions!</p>

        <title>Examples (and how to write them)</title>
        <p>Here's a note about the difference between a proposition in math (versus formal logic). In math, we understand propositions (and theorems, lemmas, corollaries, etc.) to be statements that are true (and proved/provable) so that we can cite them when we need to use them. You can see the confusion that would ensue if a paper contained "Proposition 1: All even integers are prime" under that assumption, even if followed immediately by a counterexample! So, if you are showing that a statement is not true as part of a writing assignment, here's what that might look like:</p>

        <paragraphs>
          <title>Example</title>
          <p>
            It is not the case that every even integer is prime. Notice that the integer <m>8</m> is even. Although <m>8</m> divides <m>24 = (2)(12)</m>, it divides neither <m>2</m> nor <m>12</m>. Therefore, by (definition of prime/proposition about prime numbers/whatever it is), <m>8</m> is not prime.
          </p>
        </paragraphs>
        
        <p>To break that down into more of a template:</p>
        
        <paragraphs>
          <title>Example</title>
          <p>
            <em>[Topic sentence: what's the point of this example?]</em> <em>[Supporting mathematical evidence, less formal than a proof, but still following the stylistic conventions of good mathematical writing!]</em> <em>[Concluding sentence.]</em>
