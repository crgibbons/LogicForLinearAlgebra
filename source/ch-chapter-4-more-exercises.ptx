  <title>Challenging Exercises</title>

  These problems require creative thinking or build on results you have proved in other problems.

	<exercise>
		<statement>
			<p>
			Statements (1) and (2) below are <em>implicitly</em> of the form <m>\lnot (\forall x \in D [p(x) \implies q(x)])</m>. 
			In this exercise, you will rewrite them to be <em>explicitly</em> of this form.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Using logical notation, rewrite each of statements (1) and (2) in this form, with appropriate domain of discourse <m>D</m>, 
						and appropriate propositional functions <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> (you may not want to use <q><m>x</m></q> as the variable). 
						You answer will look like 
						<me>
							\lnot \bigg(\forall \underline{\qquad} \in \underline{\qquad}\,\, [ \underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad} \implies \underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad}] \bigg)
						</me>
						with the blanks filled in appropriately.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Use part (a) to rewrite the statement, with <q><m>\lnot</m></q> moved as far to the right as possible.  
						(Your answer should still use formal logic notation.)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Express the statement in (b) in as simple an English sentence as possible; 
						i.e.,  it should not sound like it was produced by a logical negation machine. 
						In this answer, you should have no formal logic notation.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Statement (1). Being nonzero is not a sufficient condition for an <m>n \times n</m>  matrix to be nonsingular.
			</p>
			<p>
				Statement (2). A consistent linear system <m>\ell</m> doesn't necessarily have a unique solution. 
				(Use <m>\mathcal{L}</m> to denote the set of all linear systems.)
			</p>
		</statement>

	<exercise>
		<p>
			Are the following pairs of statements logically equivalent?  
			If yes, simply state <q>Yes.</q>  If no, give an example in which one statement is true and the other is false, 
			where the domain of discourse <m>A</m> is the set of all Hamilton students.  
			(You will have to decide what properties of students <m>p(x)</m>  and <m>q(x)</m> represent. Be imaginative!)

\chapter{Set Theory}

Every set $A$ is made up of its members.  If $a$ is a member of $A$, we write $a \in A$, and we use the symbol ``$\in$'' as the mathematical equivalent of the phrase ``is a member of.'' and a set A. 

We think of sets as their own objects.  If $B$ is another set, and if for every $a \in A$ it follows that $a \in B$, then we say that $A$ is a \textbf{\textit{subset}} of $B$, and we write $A \subseteq B$.  

For example, $\{1,2\}$ is a subset of $\{1,2,3\}$ (i.e., $\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$), but $\{1,4\}$ is not (i.e., $\{1,4\} \not \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$). From this definition, it is clear that a set is a subset of itself.  We say that the sets $A$ and $B$ are \defi{equal} (and we write $A = B$), if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.

Just as arithmetic features operations on numbers, set theory features operations on sets:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{\textit{union}} of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$, is the set of all objects that are a member of $A$, or $B$, or both. Example:
\[\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{2, 3, 4\}=\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\]
\item The \textbf{\textit{intersection}} of the sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, is the set of all objects that are members of both 
$A$ and $B$. Example:
\[\{1, 2, 3\}\cap \{2, 3, 4\}= \{2, 3\}\]
\end{itemize}

\colorlet{circle area}{blue!20}

\tikzset{filled/.style={fill=circle area, draw=circle edge, thick},
outline/.style={draw=circle edge, thick}}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
% A or B
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[filled] \firstcircle node {$A$}
                             \secondcircle node{$B$};
\node[anchor=south] at (current bounding box.north) {${A \cup B}$};
\end{tikzpicture}\qquad\qquad
% A and B
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{scope}
    \clip \firstcircle;
    \fill[filled] \secondcircle;
\end{scope}
\draw[outline] \firstcircle node {$A$};
\draw[outline] \secondcircle node {$B$};
\node[anchor=south] at (current bounding box.north) {$A \cap B$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

There are lots of other operations on sets (\textit{set difference}, \textit{symmetric difference}, \textit{Cartesian product}, \textit{power set}, \textit{disjoint union}, \textit{complement}, and more!), but usually we only need to worry about unions and intersections.

Some basic sets of central importance to us in linear algebra are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the empty set (the unique set containing no elements), which we denote by $\{ \, \}$ or $\varnothing$; 
\item the set of natural numbers, which we denote by $\mathbb{N}$; 
\item the set of integers, which we denote by $\mathbb{Z}$; 
\item the set of rational numbers, which we denote by $\mathbb{Q}$;
\item the set of real numbers, which we denote by $\mathbb{R}$; and
\item the set of complex numbers, which we denote by $\mathbb{C}$.
\end{itemize}
